# Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Case-Study
This is a preview of the first case study I have done to start my Data Analytics journey.

The Google Data Analytics course provides some case studies to work on to get you started. The first case study I chose was for a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic. They have both casual riders and annual members. They would like know how these two groups differ. Below shows my process to answering this question.

#### Business Task
Analyze rider data to determine differences between casual riders and annual members to help with influencing riders to become members.

#### Data Source
The data was provided by Motivate International Inc. This is an open-source data set, so the data does not include any personal information. This data included information for each trip taken throughout the year 2022 and was separated by month.
